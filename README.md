This skeleton is part of the [Aurelia](http://www.aurelia.io/) platform. It sets up a standard aurelia plugin using gulp to build your ES6 code with the Babel compiler. Karma/Jasmine testing is also configured.

If you have questions, we invite you to [join us on Gitter](https://gitter.im/aurelia/discuss). If you would like to have deeper insight into our development process, please install the [ZenHub](https://zenhub.io) Chrome Extension and visit any of our repository's boards. You can get an overview of all Aurelia work by visiting [the framework board](https://github.com/aurelia/framework#boards).

## Usage

### Install the plugin

To install the plugin, run this command in your Aurelia project root:

```
$ jspm install github:heruan/aurelia-breadcrumbs
```

or

```
$ npm install github:heruan/aurelia-breadcrumbs
```

### Load the plugin

In Aurelia's bootstrap configuration, load the plugin with:

```
aurelia.use.plugin("aurelia-breadcrumbs");
```

### Use the custom element in your views

Finally, in your views use the custom element like this:

```
<template>
    <nav>
        <a repeat.for="nav of router.navigation" href="#">${nav.title}</a>
    </nav>
    <breadcrumbs></breadcrumbs>
    <router-view></router-view>
</template>
```

## Building The Code

To build the code, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```
3. Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g gulp
  ```
4. To build the code, you can now run:

  ```shell
  gulp build
  ```
5. You will find the compiled code in the `dist` folder, available in three module formats: AMD, CommonJS and ES6.

6. See `gulpfile.js` for other tasks related to generating the docs and linting.
